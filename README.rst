This plugin extends and customizes the `edx-platform`_ by leveraging Open edX and Django events to trigger specific actions. Key features include:

- **Post to Webhook URL:** Sends data to a specified URL based on the eox-hooks settings.
- **Get Extended Certificate Data:** Adds comprehensive certificate information to the webhook request.
- **Trigger Enrollments Creation:** Initiates an asynchronous task to enroll users in a list of courses.
- **Trigger Grades Assignment:** Propagates grades to a specified course component.
- **Create Enrollments for Program:** Enroll users in a predefined list of courses constituting a Course Program.


Installation
=============

#. Add this plugin in your Tutor ``config.yml`` with the ``OPENEDX_EXTRA_PIP_REQUIREMENTS`` setting.

   .. code-block:: yaml
      
      OPENEDX_EXTRA_PIP_REQUIREMENTS:
         - eox-hooks=={{version}}
         
#. Save the configuration with ``tutor config save``.
#. Build the image and launch your platform with ``tutor local launch``.


Usage
======

Before using eox-hooks, you need to set ``USE_EOX_HOOKS`` in ``True`` and configure ``EOX_HOOKS_DEFINITIONS`` in each tenant or site configuration that wants to use the plugin as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    USE_EOX_HOOKS: True
    EOX_HOOKS_DEFINITIONS:
    {
        "<trigger_event>":
        {
            "action": "<action_name>",
            "config":
            {
                "url": "https://webhook.site",
            },
            "fail_silently": False,
            "module": "<path_to_module>",
        },
    }

Where:

- **trigger_event:** The name of the event the platform sends and eox-hooks listen, such as ``post_enrollment``. For a detailed list, visit the `trigger events examples file <docs/trigger_event_examples.rst>`_.
- **action_name:** Specify the name of the action to execute. For example: ``custom_action``. To see the available actions in eox-hooks, visit the `default hook actions file <docs/default_hook_actions.rst>`_.
- **config:** Adds more information to the action.
- **fail_silently:** Defines what happens if an exception arises while executing the action. If ``False``, then the exception is raised.
- **path_to_module:** Path to the module defining the action to execute. For example: ``eox_hooks.actions``.

Example
########

.. code-block:: yaml

    EOX_HOOKS_DEFINITIONS:
    {
        "post_register":
        {
            "action": "post_to_webhook_url",
            "config":
            {
                "fields": { "recipient_email": "user.pii.email" },
                "send_certificate_data": False,
                "url": "https://webhook.site",
            },
            "fail_silently": True,
            "module": "eox_hooks.actions",
        },
    }

- If the Open edX release is compatible with the current eox-hooks version (see `Compatibility Notes <https://github.com/eduNEXT/eox-hooks?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-notes>`_), the default configuration is sufficient.
- If incompatible, you can refer to the README from the relevant version tag for configuration details (e.g., `v5.1.0 README <https://github.com/eduNEXT/eox-hooks/blob/v5.1.0/README.rst>`_).
